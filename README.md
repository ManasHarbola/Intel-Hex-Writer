# Intel-Hex-Writer
Python script for generating and editing Intel \*.HEX files for EEPROM programming according to user specifications.

## How does it work?
When run, the script will ask how many lines you wish to write, followed by how many bytes you wish to write in each lines, the starting address, and the data itself.

## Disclaimer:
As of now, the code for this project is quick and dirty so be careful when using it!
